# Financial-Risk-Detection

**Project Overview:**********
Financial Risk Detection: This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at high risk of default on financial obligations. The model is based on a comprehensive analysis of financial, demographic, and behavioral data.

**Workflow:**

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** 
• Acquire data from various sources, including application forms, previous loan history, and credit bureau inquiries. 
• Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** 
• Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, relationships, and key risk factors associated with default. 
• Use visualizations and statistical techniques to gain insights into the data.

**Feature Engineering:** 
• Create new features and transform existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power. 
• Apply feature scaling and one-hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling.

**Model Training and Evaluation:** 
• Train a Random Forest classifier using the preprocessed data. 
• Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
• Conduct cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
